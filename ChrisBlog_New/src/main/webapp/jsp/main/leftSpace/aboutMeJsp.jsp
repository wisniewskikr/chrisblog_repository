		I graduated from the University of Szczecin (The Faculty of Economics and Management) 
		and since then I have been working as a Java Developer. In the meanwhile
		I also graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology (The Faculty of Management) and 
		obtained some Java certificates.

	<h2>What technologies and programming languages are you familiar with?</h2>
	
	<p>
		I`m familiar with the common <b>Java language</b> (Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5.0., 
		Sun Microsystems), <b>Java Web Components</b> (Sun Certified Web Component Developer for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5.0, 
		Sun Microsystems) and <b>Java Business Components</b> (Sun Certified Business Component Developer for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5.0,
